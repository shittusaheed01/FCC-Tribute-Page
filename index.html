   <h2>Here's a time line of Fela Kuti's life:</h2>
   <div id="ul">
   <ul>
    <li><span>1938</span> - Born in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria.</li>
    <li><span>1958</span> - He was sent to London to study medicine, but decided to study music instead at the Trinity College of Music, the trumpet being his preferred instrument.</li>
    <li><span>1960</span> - Fela married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with whom he would have three children (Femi, Yeni, and
    Sola).</li>
    <li><span>1963</span> - Fela moved back to the newly independent Federation of Nigeria, re-formed Koola Lobitos and trained as a radio producer
    for the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation.</li>
    <li><span>1967</span> - Fela went to Ghana looking for a new musical direction. It was then that Kuti first called his music Afrobeat, a
    combination of highlife, funk, jazz, salsa, calypso and traditional Nigerian Yoruba music.</li>
    <li><span>1969</span> - Fela took the band to the United States where they spent 10 months in Los Angeles.</li>
    <li><span>1970</span> - After Fela and his band returned to Nigeria, the group was renamed the Afrika '70, as lyrical themes changed from love
    to social issues.</li>
    <li><span>1972</span> - Ginger Baker recorded Stratavarious with Fela appearing alongside Bobby Tench. Around this time, Kuti became even
    more involved in the Yoruba religion.</li>
    <li><span>1977</span> - Fela and the Afrika '70 released the album Zombie, a scathing attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to
    describe the methods of the Nigerian military[</li>
    <li><span>1978</span> - He married 27 women, namely: Kikelomo Oseyni, Folake Oladejo, Tejumade Adebiyi, Naa Lamiley, Sewaa Kuti, Omotola Osaeti,
    Omowunmi Oyedele, Alake Anikulapo Kuti, Shade Shodeinde, Adeola Williams, Najite Kuti, Emaruagheru Osawe, Kevwe
    Oghomienor, Ihase Anikulapo, Adejonwo Iyabode Ogunitro, Bose Anikulapo Kuti, Lara Anikulapo Kuti, Suru Eriomola, Tokunbo
    Akran, Funmi Kuti, Omowunmi Afesumo, Laide Anikulapo Kuti, Ronke Edason, Damiregba Anikulapo Kuti, Aduni Idowu, Omolara
    Shosanya Remilekun Taylor, many of whom were his dancers, composers, and singers.</li>
    <li><span>1979</span> - He put himself forward for president in Nigeria's first elections for more than a decade, but his candidature was
    refused.</li>
    <li><span>1980</span> - Fela created a new band called Egypt '80 reflecting the idea that Egyptian civilization, knowledge, philosophy,
    mathematics, and religious systems are African and must be claimed as such.</li>
    <li><span>1984</span> - Muhammadu Buhari's government, of which Kuti was a vocal opponent, jailed him on a charge of currency smuggling which
    Amnesty International and others denounced as politically motivated.</li>
    <li><span>1986</span> - Fela performed in Giants Stadium in New Jersey as part of the Amnesty International A Conspiracy of Hope concert,
    sharing the bill with Bono, Carlos Santana, and the Neville Brothers</li>
    <li><span>1989</span> - Fela and Egypt '80 released the anti-apartheid Beasts of No Nation that depicts on its cover U.S. President Ronald
    Reagan, UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and South African State President Pieter Willem Botha; the title of the
    composition, as Barrett noted, evolved out of a statement by Botha: "This uprising [against the apartheid system] will
    bring out the beast in us."[</li>
    <li><span>1990</span> - Fela's album output slowed, and eventually he stopped releasing albums altogether.</li>
    <li><span>1983</span> - He and four members of the Afrika '70 organization were arrested for murder. The battle against
    military corruption in Nigeria was taking its toll, especially during the rise of Sani Abacha. Rumours were also
    spreading that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing treatment.</li>
    <li><span>1997</span> - Dies at the age of 58</li>
   </ul>

    <p><i>To think how many Africans suffer in oblivion. That makes me sad, despite my sadness, I create joyful rhythms, I
        am an
        artist, I want people to be happy and I can do it by playing happy music. And through happy music I tell them
        about the
        sadness of others, so really I am using my music as a weapon.</i></p>
